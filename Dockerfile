# Building this Image will include the running of all benchmarks in a "cold
# cache" state, and thus will take quite a bit of time (roughly 30-60 minutes,
# with Ganache excluded).  The cache will be retained in the built Image, such
# that running the Image will execute benchmarks with a "warm cache". For
# example:
#
#   docker build -t sim .
#   docker run -t sim benchmark-hardhat
#
# To benchmark with a cleared cache, and without having to rebuild the entire
# tool environment, use something like:
#
#   docker run --entrypoint /bin/bash -t sim -c "rm -rf cache && make benchmark-hardhat"
#
# You can also copy the cache from the built container to your docker host, so
# that it will be incorporated into a subsequent build of the Image, allowing a
# "warm cache" run in a freshly built Image. To do this, use something like:
#
#   id=$(docker create sim)
#   docker cp $id:/home/user/sushi-update-pools-simulation/cache .
#   docker rm -v $id
#   # source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/31316636/406289
#   docker build -t sim .
#
# BEWARE: This Image should not be published because it will contain your .env
# file, which contains your RPC url, which likely contains your private API key
# secret. (See https://stackoverflow.com/a/40762010/406289 .) Future work can
# take advantage of Docker's support for secrets, but unless/until there's a
# need to publish this Image, that would be overkill.
#
# Note: Lines in this file starting with "#   " are assumed to be example usage
# commands and are verified by ./testDockerfile.sh
